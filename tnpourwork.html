        <h1>Youth Education</h1>
 <h2> Classroom sessions </h2>
 <p> We are committed to teaching children about our coastline and the animals that reside along it through classrom sessions.
   Topics include: Marine Invertebrates, Marine Vertebrates,  Turtles of the Mediterranean,
   Dangers of Plastic Pollution, Climate Change in our Oceans, Entering a microscopic world and
   Sharks vs Dolphins. These courses can be tailored in length and content to meet the exact
   national curriculum requirements of any institution. Available from years 2 – 13 (academic years).
</p>

  <h2> Field Trips</h2>
  <p> One of our most popular offerings is the Coast Crawler Field Trip where children learn about
     the marine invertebrates along the coastline. Children get a full interactive
     experience in our Capture, Learn and Relase (CLR) programme,  where they begin to understand the habitats and feeding
      behaviours of these amazing creatures.
 </p>

      <h2> Survey Sessions</h2>
      <p> Focused on collecting data for science GCSE or A’Level course practical requirements.
         We have a number of custom projects which reliably meet the demands of practical work.
If you are interested in booking a survey session then please Contact Us soonest to avoid disappointment</p>

        <h1>Marine Research</h1>
 <h2> Field Research </h2>
  <p>We are currently undertaking a large variety of field research. This includes closely monitoring
    the coastline populations of the European spider crab, triton snail and our incredible long and
    short snouted seahorses. This is undertaken through a combination of SCUBA and snorkeling, where
    the animals are identified and important information such as size, weight and sex are recorded.
    In conjunction, we have stepped into the microscopic world, with one of our leading members, Lewis Stagnetto,
    currently conducting a PhD into the phytoplankton population structure in the Straits of Gibraltar.
</p>

  <h2> Lab Research </h2>
  <p> At the present moment we are in the process of setting up a laboratory premises. Here, we hope to conduct
     more targeted research on our marine species which will directly contribute to the wealth of marine
      knowledge locally and beyond.

    <div class="row">

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h1>Environment Protection </h1>
<p> <h2> Beach Clean-Ups </h2>
  <p> We run a large number of beach clean-ups throughout the year to help remove unwanted plastic and litter
     from our coastline. These often occur in conjunction with local companies, who engage their employees in
      this environmental practice. Coastal waters clean-ups are also undertaken in which our team take to the
      sea often by snorkeling or SCUBA to remove debris from the sea bed.  </p>

  <h2>Sustainability Awards </h2>
      <p> Every year we host The Nautilus Sustainability Awards, in which organisations
      are carefully selected for their outstanding green credentials. Throughout the year smaller awards
      are given to businesses which are reforming their practices in a green manner. This includes the
      #Plastic2Paper and #PawsOffStraws initiatives.  </p>

      <h2> Animal Protection
</h2>
      <p>
Much of our marine research is conducive towards attaining a good understanding on the population dynamics
 of Girbatlar’s vulnerable species. With the requisite knowledge, we can begin to implement measures of
 habitat protection and species conservation, further gathering the support of our local authorities.
